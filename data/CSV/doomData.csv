AE0117,Shape Of Things To Come,,Odyssey,Doom,Cycle I,Half-Page,1,"All is not well on Crete. In the absence of Minos, dissent grows. The understaffed Horned Guard struggles to keep the peace after years of oppressive rule. In dawn's grey mists, Primordial silhouettes are seen cresting the mountain ranges, too far to be a threat, too close to completely expel them from the mind.

Even your Titans are powerless to stop it.<<NL>>The Truth of the Labyrinth grows louder by the day, the words of its reluctant prophet, the Punished, reach more and more ears. While the Labyrinthian numbers soar, their actions grow bolder. Maze-tattooed pilgrims become a common sight on coastal roads. The Truth of the Labyrinth they teach with disarming honesty and humility worms its way into the stoutest of hearts. Their connection to the Primordials is no longer contained to gossip and hearsay.

AE0119,No Way Out,,Odyssey,Doom,Cycle I,Half-Page,3,"Some say the Punished has been put to death, others that he is jailed and tortured in the Daedalus Vault. However gruesome his fate, it has not turned the tide. The Labyrinth grows vaster every day. It consumes plains, forests, rivers. It transforms the cities and those who inhabit them.
