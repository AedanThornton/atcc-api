AH0147,Odys Zero,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,,Mini American,"Odys Zero was the last to wake up of the original four. He's impulsive, nonchalant and overly brave (or stupid). Many call him 'the Nevercaptain', for he wanted to lead the Argonauts, only for that honor to fall to Circegard. Lately, Odys Zero sleeps uneasily. Terrible dreams haunt him. Visions of the Zero Point Entity and its arrival in the skies above Alexandria. The blinding flash that sears the disappearing city skyline deep into his retinas. Those dreams are becoming more intense. A voice accompanies them now. It whispers: ""Follow the light of Pharos.""",Courage,,
AH0148,Circegard,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,,Mini American,"Circegard does not remember how she lost an eye. Strangely, she does not harbor resentment... as if she deserved it. Calm and collected, she was anointed by the outcast council to lead the Argo after her stand against the Hermesian Pursuer. Many feel she lacks the empathy to lead the crew, while others argue that a cold calculated approach is exactly what the Argo needs in these dark times. As for Circegard, she spends more and more time junctioning with her Titan. In its mind's eye she found a... spark",Wisdom,,
AH0149,Phenelope,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,,Mini American,"Aloof Phenelope is as deadly, as she is beautiful. With a natural affinity for all things machina, she shares her time between the battlefield and the Last Academy, where she helps decipher the phos scriptures. Her fair complexion and gentle features betray a foreign heritage. Some even say she resembles the Silver People, though only the Atlanteans could verify these bold claims -- and they sleep in their watery graves",Will,,
AH0150,Telebacchus,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,,Mini American,"The always jovial Telebacchus is the heart of the crew and serves as an intermediary between the 'mere mortals' and the 'awakened' Argonauts. He's also the only one who truly enjoys junctioning with his Titan, which he finds enlightening and uplifting",Endurance,,
AH0151,Herakleides,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,,Mini American,"Herakleides is a bit lost. When he looks into his reflection, he sees an old man, his stories done and told, his debt for the world paid in full, with interest. That is what he sees. What he remembers is... nothing. He's like a young boy, eager and anxious to be tested on the stage of Hellas",Cunning,,
AH0152,Olympia,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,,Mini American,"Olympia is a kind and gentle soul, out of place in this world of darkness and violence. Olympia herself knows that too -- that is why she is fighting so hard, to create a better, more beautiful world, if not for her, then for those who come after",Fury,,
AH0153,Leocules,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,,Mini American,"Leocules doesn't know who he was and he doesn't care a bit. His body remembers: the hardships and the struggles of a life fought and won. The violence. He treats his awakening from the Mausoleum as an opportunity: to become a gentler, more empathetic man, at peace with himself",Will,,
AH0154,Raz,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,,Mini American,"Raz knows she hails from the Forbidden East, where an ancient Empire is said to have risen to immense power and wealth. She finds she has little in common with those notions, as the only thing she seeks is knowledge",Courage,,
AH0155,Fisher,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,,Mini American,"Fisher is told she looks cold and calculating. She likes it that way, it makes her interactions with the world that much easier. She's pragmatic and driven, though she knows, maybe better than anyone else, that the Argo's mission is bigger than any single ambition. She will make sure it reaches its destination, whatever it is",Cunning,,
AH0623,Argonaut,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,,Mini American,"This is your story, yet unwritten",Choose,,
AH0624,Argonaut,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,,Mini American,"This is your story, shrouded in Past's mists",Choose,,
AH0625,Argonaut,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,,Mini American,"This is your story, to remember or reforge",Choose,,
AH0626,Argonaut,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,,Mini American,Follow your dreams,Choose,,
DH2062,Hypatia,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle IV,,Mini American,"Hypatia is a boisterous, larger-than-life member of your crew, prone to roughhousing and reckless outbursts. Wherever she goes, she brings an air of lighthearted humor with her, able to brighten any dour mood. When asked what she remembers of awakening in the Argonaut Mausoleum, she laughs, joking that she shouldn't be here at all, making up a story about being caught up in nets of the last Titanaktisos expedition",Fury,,
DH2063,Anakreon,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle IV,,Mini American,"Distant, reserved, aloof. All of these descriptors and more have been given to Anakreon by the Argo's crew. He carries himself with an air of superiority, bordering on arrogance. With his sharp, almost feline features and shock of hair as pale as polished sireshell, some whisper that he is a descendant of the Silver Ones, oof Atlantis itself. Maybe he is one of the Silver Princes, returned just in time to face the Eschaton. Or maybe that's just a fairytale, wishful thinking in a dark time...",Endurance,,
DH2064,Anathea of Baktria,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle IV,,Mini American,"The Argo's crew were quick to assume that Anathea was of Baktria, in the shadow of the Silk Road that reaches far beyond the bounds of Hellas to the East. That would certainly explain the wanderlust in her eyes, and the fiery restlessness in her heart. Driven by a desire to grasp the horizon and find out what lies beyond the next mountiain range, she has taken to the voyaging life of the Argo with gusto. Who knows to which far-flung corner of the world the city-ship will take her?",Endurance,,
DH2065,Orphan of D'Mt,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle IV,,Mini American,"In spite of the void in their memories left by the awakening process of the Mausoleum, there is one thing that stands clear in the Orphan's mind--they have known lineliness, and loss. This overwhelming sense of emptiness drives them as keenly as any instinct, both to protect what little they have found aboard the Argo, and to struggle to get by without help. The need for familial connections is constantly at war with their independent streak. They would give their all for the Argo, even if that meant losing their own place on the ship",Courage,,
DH2066,Aster,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle IV,,Mini American,"Every time Aster closes her eyes, she can see it. A city of gold and glass, stretching ever upwards. Everything you could wish for, within reach of your fingertips. If you could afford it. For those born into the shadows below, there is no such paradise. Just toil and privation. Deep within, she's known this life of struggle, understands it. And yet now, she's an Argonaut, living atop the mighty city-ship. To some, it would seem like she's made it, climbed out of that old, black pit. Hasn't she?",Will,,
DH2067,Dastan,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle IV,,Mini American,"Since the first moment he awoke in the Mausoleum, Dastan has felt a compulsion to look upward, to dream skyward. His sleeping thouts swell with visions of reaching to the heavens, and beyond. In a world where mortals war over resources and land, perhaps out there, in the great reaches past the clouds, there might be enough for everyone...",Wisdom,,
DH2068,Aktisaeos,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle IV,,Mini American,"While he may not recall much from his time before the Mausoleum, there is one thing Aktisaeos is certain of -- he was once destined for greatness. He can feel it in his very bones, in the depths of his gut. This leads him to tend to step forward into leadership, often addressing the crew of the Argo and the disparate peoples the city-ship encounters with an authoritative, commanding tone",Fury,,
DH2069,Oleander,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle IV,,Mini American,"A road vanishing into the East, a Kingdom under the sky, mountains like the spine of some megalithic corpse. These images and more fill Oleander's dreams, fadingeach morning as they awaken to the life of an Argonaut. Fight, struggle, survive. Is that all there is for them? No, there must be more. That open horizon and total liberation they see in their mind's eye... They'll have that, someday. Once the Argo's mission is over. Once they've helped bring peace to the world",Wisdom,,
DH2112,Ómorfos,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle IV,,Mini American,"Since their awakening in the Mausoleum, Ómorfos has been underestimated by those around them. People see the chiseled jawline, the broad shoulders, and the heavyset build, and assume them to be some kind of bull-headed brute. Not so, for this Argonaut carries all the shrewdness and cunning of an Atlantean, and if you've underestimated them, you've already slipped into their trap",Cunning,,
AH0000,Baselios,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,Promo,Mini American,"A spirited strategist and irrepressible optimist, Baseleos is undaunted by the harsh and challenging world of post-Eschaton Hellas. Ready to take on the towering responsibilities of an Argonaut, he is determined to let no foe stand in the way of his pursuit of a better tomorrow",Courage,,
