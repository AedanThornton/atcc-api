AH0147,Odys Zero,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,Mini American,"Odys Zero was the last to wake up of the original four. He's impulsive, nonchalant and overly brave (or stupid). Many call him 'the Nevercaptain', for he wanted to lead the Argonauts, only for that honor to fall to Circegard. Lately, Odys Zero sleeps uneasily. Terrible dreams haunt him. Visions of the Zero Point Entity and its arrival in the skies above Alexandria. The blinding flash that sears the disappearing city skyline deep into his retinas. Those dreams are becoming more intense. A voice accompanies them now. It whispers: ""Follow the light of Pharos.""",Courage,,
AH0148,Circegard,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,Mini American,"Circegard does not remember how she lost an eye. Strangely, she does not harbor resentment... as if she deserved it. Calm and collected, she was anointed by the outcast council to lead the Argo after her stand against the Hermesian Pursuer. Many feel she lacks the empathy to lead the crew, while others argue that a cold calculated approach is exactly what the Argo needs in these dark times. As for Circegard, she spends more and more time junctioning with her Titan. In its mind's eye she found a... spark.",Wisdom,,
AH0149,Phenelope,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,Mini American,"Aloof Phenelope is as deadly, as she is beautiful. With a natural affinity for all things machina, she shares her time between the battlefield and the Last Academy, where she helps decipher the phos scriptures. Her fair complexion and gentle features betray a foreign heritage. Some even say she resembles the Silver People, though only the Atlanteans could verify these bold claims -- and they sleep in their watery graves.",Will,,
AH0150,Telebacchus,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,Mini American,"The always jovial Telebacchus is the heart of the crew and serves as an intermediary between the 'mere mortals' and the 'awakened' Argonauts. He's also the only one who truly enjoys junctioning with his Titan, which he finds enlightening and uplifting.",Endurance,,
AH0151,Herakleides,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,Mini American,"Herakleides is a bit lost. When he looks into his reflection, he sees an old man, his stories done and told, his debt for the world paid in full, with interest. That is what he sees. What he remembers is... nothing. He's like a young boy, eager and anxious to be tested on the stage of Hellas.",Cunning,,
AH0152,Olympia,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,Mini American,"Olympia is a kind and gentle soul, out of place in this world of darkness and violence. Olympia herself knows that too -- that is why she is fighting so hard, to create a better, more beautiful world, if not for her, then for those who come after.",Fury,,
AH0153,Leocules,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,Mini American,"Leocules doesn't know who he was and he doesn't care a bit. His body remembers: the hardships and the struggles of a life fought and won. The violence. He treats his awakening from the Mausoleum as an opportunity: to become a gentler, more empathetic man, at peace with himself.",Will,,
AH0154,Raz,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,Mini American,"Raz knows she hails from the Forbidden East, where an ancient Empire is said to have risen to immense power and wealth. She finds she has little in common with those notions, as the only thing she seeks is knowledge.",Courage,,
AH0155,Fisher,Odyssey,Argonaut,Cycle I,Mini American,"Fisher is told she looks cold and calculating. She likes it that way, it makes her interactions with the world that much easier. She's pragmatic and driven, though she knows, maybe better than anyone else, that the Argo's mission is bigger than any single ambition. She will make sure it reaches its destination, whatever it is.",Cunning,,
