Track your progress on doing so by marking nodes on the Mnemos track. If this Gear card is equipped by another Argonaut, continue keeping track on the original sheet. If the Argonaut the original sheet belongs to dies, transfer the progress to another living Argonaut’s sheet. If you permanently lose the Gear card, erase it from the sheet; you lose all evolution progress on it.

Heal. Take the top card from the Wound Stack and remove it from the Battle. It does not provide resources at the end of the Battle.

Heartseeker. During the Draw BP card step of a Titan Attack Sequence, you may look at the top two BP cards and choose which one to attack. Shuffle the other card back into the deck.

Hermes Move X. Perform up to X Hermes Moves. 
Hermes Move. To perform a Hermes Move, draw a straight line in any cardinal direction from the Titan performing the action, stopping when you hit a Terrain tile. Then, choose an Elevated Terrain tile space, either the one the line ended on or one on a space adjacent to the spaces the drawn line went through, and place the Titan on that Terrain tile.
Must Be Empty. The chosen Terrain tile space must be empty. When performing more than one Hermes Move from a single action, only the final Hermes Move needs to follow this rule.

Hermes Reflex. Perform one Hermes Move.
Advanced Hermes Reflex. Perform up to two Hermes Moves instead.

Hermes Reposition X. During the second ability window, you may resolve Hermes Move X.

Knocked Back Titans. 
Ignore Terrain except Obstacles. Knocked back Titans ignore all Terrain tiles they move through except Obstacles. 
Destructible Obstacles. If a Titan would be forced to move through a Destructible Obstacle Terrain tile, stop its movement, remove the Terrain tile from the Battle Board and place the Titan in its space, then the Titan suffers {Crash}. 
Indestructible Obstacles. If a Titan would be forced to move through an Indestructible Obstacle, it stops on an adjacent space right before the Obstacle instead, then suffers {Crash}. 
Knocked Back Primordials. Knocked Back Primordials can move through any Terrain tiles and miniatures without hindrance. They destroy any Terrain tiles (except Indestructible) they move through and cause {Crash} and Unavoidable Knockback to Titans as normal.

Lifeline. When you are about to die from a Chasm space, Displace instead (in Cycle 4, you may instead place the Titan on the closest Irem Tower Terrain tile). Alternatively, when you are about to die from falling from a Boundless Board Edge, stop adjacent to it. This ability can be used even if Knocked Down or otherwise prohibited from using active abilities. 

Light X. Game elements on the Battle Board with this keyword emit light and are considered light sources. This ability is disabled on a game element owned by a Titan if that Titan cannot use abilities, the element is exhausted, or the element is Smothered (X.X.X).

Pursuit X. When resolving an AI card, if you’re not a Target, move X spaces in a straight line in the same direction as the Primordial.

Pushback X. Turn the source towards the affected miniature. Then, move X spaces in the direction of the affected miniature, pushing it in a straight line.
Other miniatures. Pushed Titans can move through spaces occupied by other miniatures. If a Titan ends involuntary movement on a space with another miniature, the other miniature is Displaced. 
Terrain. The affected miniature must resolve the effects of any Terrain tiles it moves through. 
Shortest path. If the affected miniature is not adjacent, move the source in its direction along the shortest possible path.
Destructible Obstacles. If a Titan is about to be pushed into a Destructible Obstacle, remove that Terrain tile from the Battle Board, the Titan suffers {Crash}, then continue Pushback. 
Indestructible Obstacles. If a Titan is about to be pushed into an Indestructible Obstacle, displace it to an adjacent space that would allow the Primordial to continue movement onto a space previously occupied by the Titan, then continue Pushback. If the Titan dies from displacement, then once the Primordial has moved into the space formerly occupied by the Titan, the Pushback stops. 
Board Edge. If a Titan or Primordial is about to be pushed into the Board Edge, it is displaced to an adjacent space in a way that would allow the source of Pushback to move onto a space previously occupied by the affected miniature, then continue Pushback.

Second Chance. After you draw a Trauma or Obol card, you may ignore its effect and discard it. Draw and resolve another card from the same deck (note: a discarded Obol is immediately shuffled back into the Obol deck). You cannot ignore the second draw in any way. This ability can be used even when knocked down or when an effect says that you cannot use any active abilities.

Cover. Titans on this tile have +1 Evasion .

Destructible. When the Primordial moves onto this tile or a Titan is involuntarily moved onto it, the tile is destroyed. 
Reinforced Destructible. When this tile would be destroyed, instead flip it and the corresponding terrain card over. It then becomes Destructible.
