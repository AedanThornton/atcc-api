      "All is not well on Crete. In the absence of Minos, dissent grows. The understaffed Horned Guard struggles to keep the peace after years of oppressive rule. In dawn's grey mists, Primordial silhouettes are seen cresting the mountain ranges, too far to be a threat, too close to completely expel them from the mind. You start to notice strange geometric graffiti adorning the walls and abandoned temples. You hear whispers of change coming from inland."
